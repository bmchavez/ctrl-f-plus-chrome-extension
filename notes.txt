Describe your project:
I am looking for a custom logo design for a chrome extension that I built. Below are the details of the extension:

 - Title: Ctrl-F Plus - Multi-Tab Search
 - Subtitle: Find Text Across All Open Tabs
 - Description: Upgrade your browsing experience with Ctrl-F Plus, a powerful Chrome extension that enables you to search through all open tabs using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl-Shift-F. Effortlessly locate specific content or keywords across multiple tabs and boost your productivity.

I am looking for something that is simple, but also conveys the functionality of the extension.

Some ideas:
 - A big "C" and "ntrl-f +" in much smaller letters
 - Just a big "C",
- A big "C" with a "+" inside of it
- spy glass
- A magnifying glass (this feels generic though)


Reference Styles:
I am currently using these two colors for the text selection when using the extension:
 - light= #05fdb4
 - dark = #128da1

I have included a screen shot of the extension being used to search for the term "google" on the google wikipedia.

Some ideas:
 - A big "C" and "ntrl-f +" in much smaller letters
 - Just a big "C",
- A big "C" with a "+" inside of it
- spy glass
- A magnifying glass (this feels generic though)


How will your design be used?:
Browser Extension, Chrome Web Store, Website Navbar Icon
